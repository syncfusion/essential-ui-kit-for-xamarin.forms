  "articleContent": "Organizing projects is now predominantly a digital endeavor. Physical whiteboards have given way to electronic Gantt charts. Pocket calendars have yielded to smartphone scheduling apps. Even the most popular tool of the most ferocious organizers\u002Dthe sticky note\u002Dnow has a digital counterpart. Despite this digitization, one shouldn\u0027t lose sight of the usefulness of articulating ideas on paper. Handwriting is still the most viable means for bringing ideas and concepts into the physical world for organizing and comparing.This isn\u0027t to say you should remain in the archaic world of markers and pens; rather, handwriting should be harnessed as the initial step in understanding a project\u002Da free association of all the ideas that pop into your head. After organizing and reorganizing your thoughts on paper, moving them into the digital realm as tasks, reminders, and schedules serves as the final refinement of what you\u0027re trying to accomplishment and how you plan to accomplish it.",
